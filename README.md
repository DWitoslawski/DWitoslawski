### I am a UNLV Masters of Computer Science Student with a B.S. in Biological Sciences, interested in data science/engineering and bioinformatcis development. I have conducted research in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, developing software tools and simulation pipelines for RNA Sequencing and alternative splicing data analysis. Currently, my graduate research is in developing a deep learning model toward elucidating the gene regulatory network and how it affects transcriptional regulation. Specifically, I am interested in predicting Transcription Start Site (TSS) using an explainable and interpretable model for downstream analysis of important promoter-enhancer interactions and motif discovery. I have experience with other genomics assays such as CHIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq/DNAse-Seq, HiC contact data, and CAGE-Seq. I am interested in developing my skills in other domains such as protein sequence analysis, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics.
